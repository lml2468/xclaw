#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/lib/build-common.sh — shared build pipeline for the package +
# release scripts. Sourced (not executed) by both zsh (package-desktop.sh,
# release.sh) and bash (package-linux-appimage.sh, CI), so every helper
# below sticks to POSIX-compatible syntax.
#
# Why this file exists: before extraction, every script that built the
# daemon, resolved the canonical version, or waited on background jobs
# carried its own copy. The first drift (CI's macOS .app version stamp
# vs. the Linux AppImage filename version) was already fixed once by
# hand. This file is the answer to "where do I change that next time?"
#
# Conventions:
# - Functions echo progress to stderr (>&2) so caller-captured stdout
#   (e.g. `ver=$(resolve_version "$root")`) stays clean.
# - No global state; every function takes its inputs as args.

# resolve_version returns the canonical version string for the build:
#   1. $OCTOBUDDY_VERSION (env override; release.sh sets this).
#   2. The contents of $repo_root/VERSION (single source of truth).
#   3. "0.0.0-dev" fallback (clean checkout, no release stamp).
# Whitespace is trimmed so a stray trailing newline in VERSION doesn't
# corrupt downstream filename + Info.plist stamping.

# build_octobuddy_daemon cross-compiles the daemon. Identical flags across

# everywhere; -trimpath strips the operator's $HOME / module-cache from
# binary paths and -buildvcs=false omits the local git-dirty flag, both
# required for byte-reproducible release artifacts.

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

OctoBuddy is a cross-platform **agent gateway**: it drives coding-agent CLIs (Claude
first) by spawning them and normalizing their output into one unified event
stream — replacing the Node-only `claude-agent-sdk`. Monorepo of three pieces
that version together against one contract:

- `core/` — Go daemon `octobuddy-daemon` (the gateway). Single static binary, **zero cgo**,
  cross-compiles to mac/linux/windows.
- `desktop/` — **Go + Wails v3** desktop app (Svelte + TS frontend, macOS/Win/Linux).
  A control-bus client; never talks to Claude directly — it spawns + drives
  `octobuddy-daemon`. The UI is a clean **WeChat/iMessage-grade** chat UI (CSS/SVG), not
  native chrome. Its Go backend reuses the wire contract directly.
- `proto/` — the language-neutral control-bus contract (NDJSON envelopes over a
  Unix socket) shared by core and the app. Spec lives in `proto/README.md`; the
  Go types live in `core/control/wire` (a dependency-free leaf both sides import).

The repo is a **Go workspace** (`go.work`) tying `./core` and `./desktop`. The
desktop module is `github.com/lml2468/octobuddy/desktop` and pulls `core` in via a
local `replace`.

## Commands

```bash
# Go core (run from core/)
cd core && go build ./... && go test ./...
go test ./gateway/ -run TestName        # single package / single test
go run ./cmd/octobuddy-daemon                       # REPL on stdin (type a msg; /reset; Ctrl-D)
go run ./cmd/octobuddy-daemon -control /tmp/octobuddy.sock   # serve control bus for GUI clients
go run ./cmd/octobuddy-daemon -config               # multi-bot from ~/.octobuddy/config.json
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o /tmp/octobuddy-daemon ./cmd/octobuddy-daemon  # cross-compile

# Desktop app (Wails v3 — needs the wails3 CLI:
#   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest)
cd desktop && go build ./... && go vet ./...
cd desktop/frontend && npm run build && npm run check   # frontend build + typecheck (svelte-check)
zsh scripts/run-dev.sh                     # build core + `wails3 dev` (needs ~/.octobuddy/config.json)
zsh scripts/run-dev.sh --seed-config       # write a starter config first
zsh scripts/run-dev.sh --preview           # UI preview: mock data, no daemon (OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW)

# Package a distributable OctoBuddy.app (+ .zip); embeds octobuddy-daemon, signs inside-out.
# ad-hoc by default; pass the identity to Developer-sign, a profile to notarize.
OCTOBUDDY_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: …" zsh scripts/package-desktop.sh
```

The desktop GUI's own visual-iteration loop is **preview mode**: launch the built
binary with `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW=1` (optional `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW_THEME=dark|light`,
`OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW_EDITOR=1`) — it seeds a mock roster + transcript and skips the
daemon, so the watercolor UI can be screenshotted without a live bot.

Go module path is `github.com/lml2468/octobuddy/core` (Go 1.26). Tests need **no API
key** — they run against recorded fixtures (`core/fixtures/`) and live CLI spawns
that only assert parsing/wiring.

## Architecture: the turn pipeline

The whole point is the `agent.Driver` abstraction. **Everything downstream of it
depends only on the `agent.AgentEvent` vocabulary, never on Claude specifics** —
adding a second agent (Codex, Gemini) means writing one new `Driver`, touching
nothing else. When changing the gateway/router/store/control bus, do not reach
into driver-specific behavior; keep the dependency pointing at `agent`.

Inbound message flows through (`core/gateway/gateway.go` `runTurn`):

```
inbound → router (mention/免@ gate → bot-loop guard → sessionKey → size gate → rate limit → per-session lock)
        → store.GetOrCreate → load resume id → groupctx backfill + answered/new segmentation
        → materialize attachments into cwd → buildSystemPrompt (SecurityPrefix + SOUL/AGENTS + roster + GROUP.md + persona)
        → driver.Query → stream AgentEvents → sink.OnEvent (typing heartbeat / opt-in tool-progress) → assemble reply
        → persist assistant text + resume id + reply cursor → sink.OnReply (mention resolution / persona voice)
```

Key invariants to preserve:

- **sessionKey derivation** (`core/router/router.go`): DM = per-peer
  (`<spaceId>:<uid>`), Group = per-channel (one shared session). Never fall back
  to `""` on an unroutable message — that would collapse unrelated peers into one
  session and leak history/memory. The router holds a **mutex-per-key** across
  the entire turn so same-session turns serialize; different sessions run
  concurrently.
- **The sandbox partition key is the SAME sessionKey** (`core/sandbox/`), prefixed
  by channel kind (`dm:` / `group:`), so a session's cwd can never drift from its
  history partition. Each session gets a deterministic hashed subdir. Note: cwd is
  a *starting* dir, not a chroot — an agent with Bash can still reach absolute
  paths; isolation across spaces is "one bot per space, separate cwdBase".
- **Resume continuity without the SDK**: `store` maps `sessionKey → resume_id`;
  the gateway persists it after a turn and passes it as `Request.SessionID` next
  turn. Sessions/messages/sandboxes are **persistent** (no TTL reclamation; the
  daemon's periodic reaper only evicts idle in-memory router lock/rate-limit
  buckets). **Self-healing**: if a turn fails because the resume id is unknown
  (driver emits `AgentEvent.ResumeInvalid` — e.g. the session predates a
  config-dir change), the gateway swallows the doomed attempt, clears the
  mapping, and retries the turn fresh.
- **Skills & workflows — per-bot only, auto-discovered by the CLI**: each bot
  owns its skills (SKILL.md bundles) under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/skills/` and
  its workflows (`*.js`) under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/workflows/`. Because
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (next bullet) points there, the claude CLI auto-loads
  them as user-scope assets every spawn — no per-turn sandbox symlinking, no
  shared marketplace, no install/uninstall concept. The gateway has no
  knowledge of skills/workflows; CRUD is the desktop's job
  (`desktop/internal/skills` + `desktop/internal/workflows`). All local-file
  I/O for skills, workflows, the workspace previewer, SOUL/AGENTS reads,
  and the daemon's own state files (config.json, cron.json, octobuddy.db
  parent dirs, IM media downloads, sandbox cwds) routes through
  `core/safepath`, which owns slug validation + lexical containment +
  structural symlink refusal (dirfd-walk on unix, Lstat-chain on windows).
  Callers MUST NOT do their own `Lstat` / `EvalSymlinks` / `O_NOFOLLOW`
  for paths under a `root` — those concerns live in safepath, period.
  Managed from the desktop per-bot Skills /
  Workflows windows.
- **Agent config isolation** (`config.DriverEnvWith`): each bot's `claude` runs
  with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude` so it does NOT inherit the
  operator's `~/.claude` (user-scope skills + installed plugins would otherwise
  leak into every bot). Auth is env-based (`ANTHROPIC_*`), so this is safe; CLI
  built-in skills still load, and the per-bot skills/workflows live under this
  same dir (`.claude/skills`, `.claude/workflows`) so the CLI finds them too.
  Opt out with `agent.inheritUserConfig: true` (trusted single-operator only).
- **ClaudeDriver headless invariants** (`core/agent/claude.go`): always spawns
  `claude -p - --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode bypassPermissions`,
  feeding the prompt on **stdin** (`-p -`, not an argv element, so a large prompt
  can't hit ARG_MAX — and never inherits the daemon's fd 0, which carries the
  control-bus cap token; MLT-40). Bypass is mandatory in **both** prompt modes —
  there is no terminal to answer approval prompts, so any other mode auto-denies
  write-class tools or hangs the turn. The tool SURFACE is scoped by `--tools`
  (orthogonal to the permission mode), NOT `--allowedTools` (which is only the
  auto-approve list under prompt-based modes and doesn't restrict what the model
  sees). The headless-safe default tool set is **probed from the live binary**
  (`ProbeTools` reads the `system/init` line's `tools` array) minus a small
  `interactiveExclusions` denylist — never a hand-maintained Go allowlist (it
  drifts per claude release: `Agent`→`Task`, `TodoWrite` dropped). When a bot
  has a `.mcp.json` this turn, the nil-policy default surface also admits
  `mcp__*` (the probe runs without `--mcp-config`, so it carries no MCP names —
  without this the servers connect but stay uncallable). Per-bot / per-channel
  whitelists + setting-source scopes flow through `agent.Request` (`AllowedTools`,
  `SettingSources`); the tool policy applies in **both** prompt modes (a muzzle
  must hold regardless of mode) and any explicit list is re-filtered against
  `interactiveExclusions`. The per-turn tool resolver re-reads `config.json`
  (`config.ToolPolicyFor` → the single `config.ToolPolicy.Resolve`), so a desktop
  edit to `tools.channels` applies on the next turn without a daemon restart —
  the same per-Query philosophy as the MCP-config / binary resolvers; the gateway
  takes a resolver closure (`WithToolResolver`) rather than caching a snapshot.
  MCP servers load from the per-bot
  `<CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR>/.mcp.json` via `--mcp-config <path> --strict-mcp-config`
  when present (`.mcp.json` is project-scope, so `--setting-sources=user` won't
  auto-load it; the path is resolved through `safepath.SafeLstat`, refusing a
  symlinked file or parent). `ProbeMCP` reads the same init line's
  `mcp_servers[].status` for the desktop's MCP health check. Output is **plain
  stream-json** (one event
  per complete content block) — the driver does NOT request
  `--include-partial-messages`, so there is no token-level delta path or dedup.
  `--append-system-prompt` (claude_code mode) is re-sent every turn including
  resumes: it does NOT persist across `--resume`, so skipping it would drop the
  non-overridable `SecurityPrefix` + SOUL (its tokens are a prompt-cache hit
  anyway); minimal mode uses `--system-prompt` (REPLACE) instead. The `result`
  line populates `TokenUsage` with cached-input tokens
  (`cache_read_input_tokens`) and `CostUSD` (`total_cost_usd`). Upstream
  rate-limit / overload / usage-cap conditions (HTTP 429/503/529, "usage limit
  reached", …) are classified as `AgentEvent.Transient` (`core/agent/classify.go`)
  with a reset-window `RetryHint`; the gateway replies `busyReply` ("服务繁忙") for
  a transient terminal error instead of the generic errorReply.
- **Feature modules layered on the pipeline** (each cites its TS source in its
  package doc): `core/cron/` — per-bot scheduled tasks, owner-gated
  `cron.create/list/delete` over the control bus; `core/groupmd/` — operator
  `<channelId>.md` → trusted `[Group instructions]`; `core/persona/` — OBO
  persona-clone reply voice. Inbound media/markers, outbound @mention
  resolution, threads, and typing/tool-progress all live in `core/im/octo/`.

## Security model (group chat / prompt injection)

Group turns carry untrusted text, so two modules guard the prompt — preserve
their ordering when touching the gateway:

- `core/safety/` — `SafeText` choke-point, `SecurityPrefix` (non-overridable,
  prepended), `CurrentMessageAnchor`, escaping. The system prompt append is
  always `SecurityPrefix` + operator-trusted SOUL.md/AGENTS.md, both wrapped as
  `TrustedText`.
- `core/groupctx/` — per-channel rolling context window + cursor + @mention
  resolution. **Critical ordering** (`runTurn`): build the `[Recent group
  messages]` delta BEFORE caching the current message, or it echoes into itself;
  the delta is sanitized as untrusted background and the real request is fenced
  by the current-message anchor.

## Config & multi-bot

`-config` loads a single `~/.octobuddy/config.json` (see `core/config.example.json`)
and runs **every bot in `bots[]` in its own fully isolated stack** — separate
store, gateway, driver, group-context, Octo connector, each under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/`.

- System prompt is **file-based, not a config field**: `<id>/SOUL.md` (identity)
  and `<id>/AGENTS.md` (behavior norms), assembled by `config.SystemPromptFor`
  into labeled `## SOUL.md` / `## AGENTS.md` sections (each with a one-line
  descriptor), passed as the operator-trusted append. Either may be omitted. The
  `##` labels are deliberately Markdown headings, NOT `[bracket]` markers, so they
  stay outside `safety.sectionMarkerRE`'s privileged namespace (untrusted text
  reproducing `## SOUL.md` forges nothing). Re-read **per turn** by the gateway's
  `WithSystemPromptResolver` (backed by `SystemPromptFor(BotRoot)`), so a desktop
  edit applies on the next message without a daemon restart — same per-Query
  pattern as the tool/MCP/binary resolvers; an empty result is honored
  (SecurityPrefix only). The rich default templates live in
  `desktop/internal/configstore` (`defaultSoulTemplate`/`defaultAgentsTemplate`).
- **First-run bootstrap (self-bootstrapping)**: a brand-new bot is scaffolded
  once with `<id>/BOOTSTRAP.md` (`defaultBootstrapTemplate`, NOT re-created on
  later saves). While it exists, `config.BootstrapFor` + the gateway's
  `WithBootstrapResolver` inject it per turn — but `appendBootstrap` gates the
  injection to an **owner-trusted channel only** (`gateway.ownerTrusted`: a
  `trigger.SourceConsole` turn — the desktop Console, trusted via control-bus
  auth — or the bot owner's IM DM, where `msg.FromUID == g.owner()`). Never in a
  group or non-owner DM, because the ritual has the bot rewrite its own SOUL.md
  (letting an untrusted user drive it = self-injection of the trusted prompt).
  The bot interviews the owner, writes SOUL.md, deletes BOOTSTRAP.md; per-turn
  reload then stops injecting it. Owner uid reaches the gateway via
  `WithOwner(connector.OwnerUID)` (lazy — known only after IM registration; the
  Console path needs no owner uid). No MEMORY.md/IDENTITY.md/USER.md: claude's
  per-session autoMemory (`--settings autoMemoryDirectory`, keyed per sessionKey)
  already gives isolated per-conversation continuity, and bot-level durable
  self-knowledge lives in SOUL/AGENTS.
- Each `bots[]` entry is `id` + `octoToken`. `apiUrl` and the whole `agent` block
  (model, gateway URL/token, env, and the capability switches `cron`,
  `toolProgress`, `inheritUserConfig`, `dispatchTimeoutSec`, `systemPromptMode`,
  `settingSources`, `tools`) are **per-bot only** — there is no top-level `agent`
  default (the `File` struct exposes only `rateLimit`/`context`/`toolset`/`bots`).
  Only `rateLimit` and `context` have top-level defaults a per-bot value
  overrides. The group-gating lists (`mentionFreeGroups`, `knownBotUids`,
  `allowedBotUids`, `botBlocklist`) plus `groupConfigDir` and `onBehalfOf` are
  also per-bot. (Skills/workflows are **not** config fields; each bot owns its own
  under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/{skills,workflows}/` — see the skills/workflows
  bullet above.) `core/config.example.json` is the canonical field list.
- `core/config/` does slug + SSRF validation on URLs — keep that on any new
  config field that holds a URL. `groupConfigDir` files are injected UNSANITIZED
  as `[Group instructions]`, so config load rejects a dir at/under a bot's
  `cwdBase` (else a user-driven agent could write its own future instructions).

## IM connector

`core/im/octo/` speaks the WuKongIM binary protocol (curve25519 DH + MD5→
AES-128-CBC key derivation, verified byte-identical to the upstream cc-channel
reference) plus REST. Inbound → router; replies go out via REST. It is one
connector behind the agent/IM-agnostic `router.InboundMessage` — the gateway
neither knows nor cares which IM is attached.
Beyond plain text it renders non-text payloads to markers, materializes inbound
media/files into the session cwd, resolves outbound @mentions, runs the OBO
persona relay + thread routing, and emits a 5 s typing heartbeat.

## Desktop app (`desktop/`)

A thin control-bus client (Wails v3 alpha + Svelte 5/TS); the daemon holds all
logic, so swapping the GUI never touches `core/`.

- **Go backend**: `main.go` (app + window + system tray + single-instance);
  `octobuddyservice.go` is the Wails-bound bridge — spawns `octobuddy-daemon`, dials the control
  socket, forwards every envelope to the frontend as the `octobuddy:event` Wails event,
  exposes command/config methods, and auto-reconnects on daemon crash.
  `internal/`: `control` (UDS/NDJSON client over `core/control/wire`), `core`
  (supervisor: resolve binary → spawn `-control … -exit-with-parent` → stop/restart),
  `configstore` (read/write `~/.octobuddy/config.json` + per-bot SOUL/AGENTS),
  `skills` (per-bot CRUD over `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/skills/` bundles) and
  `workflows` (same, for `*.js`), all with slug + path-traversal validation,
  `octocli` (bundle/install/upgrade the octo-cli
  companion), `secrets` (tokens in the OS credential store via go-keyring,
  zero cgo; injected at runtime, **never** written to config.json).
- **Frontend** (`frontend/src`): `lib/store.svelte.ts` is the single reducer —
  it folds `octobuddy:event` envelopes into bots/sessions/messages and owns the
  rAF typewriter/coalescing. Components in `lib/components/` (Sidebar · Transcript ·
  Bubble · Composer · SettingsModal + 4 panes (BasicInfo · OctoIntegration · Skills ·
  Workflows) · TokenUsage · WorkspacePanel · FilePreview · Confirm · ErrorFooter ·
  Avatar); the global `lib/confirm.svelte.ts` mounts `<Confirm>` programmatically;
  tokens in `lib/styles/theme.css`.
- **Workspace sidebar** (`WorkspacePanel`): a chat-header toggle button opens an
  inline (NOT modal — no scrim) right-hand column inside `.content`, showing the
  selected session's sandbox file tree. Selecting a file opens `FilePreview` as a
  wide pane that takes the chat's flex slot (rail · preview · tree) — App owns the
  `previewPath` state; ✕/Esc clears it back to the chat, and switching session
  clears it too. `FilePreview` renders by kind — Markdown (rendered, with a
  Rendered/Raw toggle), code/text (line-number gutter + `highlight()` from
  `lib/markdown.ts`), images (Fit/Actual), and PDF (inline `<iframe>` data-URL) —
  reusing the chat's markdown CSS + `onMarkdownCopyClick`. Backend reads the
  filesystem directly via two Wails methods (`WorkspaceTree`/`WorkspaceFile` →
  `desktop/internal/workspace`); since the frontend doesn't carry the channel kind,
  the package resolves the cwd by trying both `dm`/`group` hashes
  (`sandbox.SessionDirName`) and using whichever dir exists. Read-only + sandboxed:
  never follows symlinks, skips `.claude/`, caps depth/entries/file-size (1 MiB for
  text, 8 MiB for base64 images/PDFs).
- **Top-level modals** (the only two): **SettingsModal** (per-bot settings —
  opens via the sidebar gear or the tray's `Settings…`, emits `octobuddy:open-settings`
  with a `{tab}` payload) and **TokenUsage** (read-only usage table — opens via
  the sidebar's chart-bar button or the tray's `Token Usage…`, emits
  `octobuddy:open-usage`). They are mutually exclusive (`App.svelte` enforces).
- **SettingsModal**: left rail = bot list + `+ 新增 Bot` (opens the Add-bot wizard
  inline — `OctoAddBot` provisions on octo-server from a uk_ key, falls back to a
  manual blank shell). Right pane = 4 segmented tabs: **基础信息**
  (`BasicInfoPane`: Bot ID, model, gateway URL/Token, env vars, SOUL.md, AGENTS.md,
  delete-bot), **Octo 集成** (`OctoIntegrationPane`: API URL, bf_ token, OCTO_BOT_ID,
  connection status, octo-cli profile status + 重新登录/登出 actions),
  **技能** (`SkillsPane`: per-bot bundles under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/skills/`),
  **工作流** (`WorkflowsPane`: per-bot `*.js` under `~/.octobuddy/<id>/.claude/workflows/`).
  Basic + Octo edits flip a single `dirty` flag surfaced in the footer's
  保存/保存并重启; Skills + Workflows write through to disk immediately. Reserved
  env keys (currently `OCTO_BOT_ID`) live in `lib/reservedEnv.ts` so BasicInfo
  hides them and Octo re-injects them without a string-literal contract drift.
- **TokenUsage** is per-bot cumulative input/output/cached tokens + cost + turns,
  plus an all-bots total, from the privileged `usage.stats`
  control command (backed by core/store's `token_usage` table, accumulated each
  turn_done in the gateway; persists across restarts). NOTE: `window.confirm/alert` are
  no-ops in the Wails webview — use an in-app dialog for any confirmation.
- **Design direction (committed — do not re-pivot)**: clean WeChat/iMessage-grade
  chat UI. Dark bot-rail → conversation list → chat; green accent (`#07c160`),
  green selected rows + outgoing bubbles, square-rounded avatars, **Geist** (Sans
  for UI, Mono for code + metadata), restrained 4–8px radii, content edge-to-edge.
  Watercolor and Liquid-Glass were both tried and rejected.
- **Verify UI by measurement, not eyeballing**: `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW=1` (with
  `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW_THEME=dark|light`, `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW_EMPTY=1`, `OCTOBUDDY_PREVIEW_EDITOR=1`)
  seeds mock data and skips the daemon. Run `wails3 dev`, then drive
  `http://127.0.0.1:9245/?preview=1&theme=dark` in headless Chrome via Playwright
  (`playwright-core` + `channel:"chrome"`) to screenshot and assert geometry
  (viewport fill, header alignment, overflow/clipping, tap-target size). This
  caught real bugs the eye missed (a template-CSS inset "ring", rail flex-overflow
  clipping).
- **macOS gotchas**: traffic lights overlap the leftmost pane — only the rail
  clears them (taller rail header); list/chat headers stay compact. Don't link a
  global `style.css` in `index.html` (the Vite template's `#app{max-width;padding}`
  re-insets everything) — `theme.css` is the single source of truth, imported in
  `App.svelte`. Keychain injection prompts on an unsigned/re-signed binary (allow
  once; a stable signing identity makes it stick). After changing Go binding
  signatures: `cd desktop && wails3 generate bindings -d frontend/bindings`.

## Lineage

Much of `core/` is a Go port of the TypeScript `cc-channel` / `cc-channel-octo`
gateway (the package docs cite the original files, e.g. `prompt-safety.ts`,
`group-context.ts`, `cwd-resolver.ts`). When porting more behavior, follow the
existing pattern of naming the source file in the package doc and preserving its
ordering/semantics rather than re-deriving them.

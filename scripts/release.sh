#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Cut a signed + notarized release from this machine. Uses scripts/package-desktop.sh
# under the hood, then renames the artifacts under a versioned scheme and
# uploads them to a GitHub Release via `gh`.
#
#   zsh scripts/release.sh v1.0.0
#
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   1. Apple Developer ID Application cert in your login Keychain. The script
#      auto-detects it; set XCLAW_SIGN_IDENTITY only when multiple "Developer
#      ID Application" certs are present and you want to pick one explicitly.
#   2. App Store Connect API key registered with notarytool under the profile
#      name "xclaw-notary" (override with XCLAW_NOTARY_PROFILE):
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials xclaw-notary \
#          --key /path/AuthKey_XXXX.p8 --key-id ABCD1234EF --issuer <uuid>
#   3. `gh auth status` shows you logged in.
#
# No env exports in ~/.zshrc needed for the common case — the script picks
# both up automatically.
#
# What it builds + uploads (universal macOS .app + all daemon binaries):
#   - XClaw-<ver>-macos-universal.zip   (signed + notarized + stapled)
#   - xclawd-<ver>-darwin-arm64
#   - xclawd-<ver>-darwin-amd64
#   - xclawd-<ver>-linux-amd64
#   - xclawd-<ver>-linux-arm64
#   - xclawd-<ver>-windows-amd64.exe
#   - checksums.txt   (sha256 of every asset above)
#
# Re-runnable: the underlying tag must be unique (Apple's notary remembers
# digests), so bump the patch version if you need to retry.

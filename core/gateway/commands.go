// In-chat slash commands, the Go port of cc-channel's src/commands.ts.
//
// Users control their session without leaving the chat:
//
//	/reset   — clear this session's conversation history
//	/config  — show the effective per-session settings
//	/help    — list available commands
//
// Commands are matched on the FIRST line of the inbound body AFTER the router
// has stripped any leading @bot mention (so `@bot /reset` works in groups).
// Matching is case-insensitive and tolerant of surrounding whitespace.
//
// A command is scoped to the sessionKey of the message. In a group the session
// is shared per channel, so /reset clears the WHOLE group's conversation
// history (every member shares one session), not just the caller's. In a DM it
// clears that peer's history. /reset does NOT clear long-term auto-memory.
//
// Commands are handled in the gateway AFTER the router's rate limit has been
// applied (they ride the accepted-turn path), so a user who has exhausted their
// token bucket cannot run /reset or /help until it refills — control commands
// are rate-limited like normal messages. This is intentional: a flooder must not
// get a rate-limit bypass via slash commands (commands.ts header).

// or `/help.md` would parse as the bare command and could trigger a destructive

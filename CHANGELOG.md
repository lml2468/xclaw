All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and
  this changelog — open-source baseline.
- GitHub Actions CI: Go build/vet/`gofmt`-gate/`test -race`, zero-cgo
  cross-compile matrix (darwin/linux/windows), and Swift build/test. Plus PR and
  issue templates.

### Changed
- Formatted the entire `core/` tree with `gofmt`.
- Converted mixed-language code comments to English.

### Fixed
- The router's per-session lock map and per-user/per-session rate-limit buckets
  no longer grow without bound: a new `Router.Reap` evicts idle entries (lock
  eviction is refcount-guarded so an in-flight turn is never reaped). A bot now
  runs a periodic reaper that also enforces the session/sandbox TTLs over the
  daemon's lifetime, instead of sweeping only once at startup. The reaper stops
  on context cancellation.
